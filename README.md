# Embed-PowerBI
Incorporating Power BI into a platform for your customers is an under-discussed topic. 
I managed to find the content in some Microsoft links and a course that is made available by time. (I'll leave the link to both below)

In the middle of all this there is a lot of code in the front-end and web development part, which made me break my head and for a long time. 
Anyway, I want to share that I was able to carry out the incorporation and offer my help with any error that may be temporarily in yours, since there are few contents and help forums in this matter.

It is a big step for those who work offering data analysis, reports and dashboards. One cost only for the PRO license! (With filter and RLS options)
